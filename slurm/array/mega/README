This is a pretty simple example of using Slurm Job Arrays to process large
numbers of small tasks.  This example is inspired by a very similar example
from the University of Florida's Research Computing center
https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/SLURM_Job_Arrays

To run this example, copy it to your home directory, `cd` into it, and run:
sbatch submit.slurm
