###In order to run the matlab file appropriately, you will need to compile it first
###The best way to do this is to start an interactive session with: 


srun --pty bash

###and then loading the matlab module


module load matlab/matlab-R2018b


###and then compiling it through matlab with the matlab compiler
###  e.g.,  mcc -m <your_input_file> -o <the_output_filename>
###For this example specifically:

  mcc -m pi.m  -o pi 

###The output file will be the executable to run.


###So, exit you interactive session

exit

###Then submit your job:

sbatch  pi-matlab.slurm

### The output to the job will be in a directory with the same
### name as your job ID.
