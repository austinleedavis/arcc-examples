Mathematica requires the user have a license. Therefore, to use Mathematica, 
you must be included in the mathematica user group, and activate your
license in an interactive session. The instructions to do so are below:  

Instructions to use Mathematica: 

	Contact Dr. Paul Wiegand at wiegand@ist.ucf.edu or Dr. Glenn Martin at 
	martin@ist.ucf.edu to be added to the mathematica user group.


	For the initial mathematica setup, ssh using X forwarding to stokes: 
		On Linux/OSX, this is done by running: 
                  ssh -Y  -i <username>_id_rsa_1  <username>@stokes.ist.ucf.edu,
		and on Windows, the easiest solution is to use MobaXterm. 

	Then type the following:
		1. srun -L mathematica@mathematica.net.ucf.edu --pty bash
		2. mathematica

	Then, select "other ways to activate", click "connect to a license
	server" and enter the following: mathematica.net.ucf.edu.

	Close the program, type exit.

	Now you can use the mathematica examples found in:
		 /groups/arcc/shared/examples/current/mathematica

        IMPORTANT: Make sure you always request the license when using srun or sbatch by either adding
        the following to your command line:
 
             -L mathematica@mathematica.net.ucf.edu

        Or by adding it to your slurm submit script:

             #SBATCH -L mathematica@mathematica.net.ucf.edu

        You can see whether there are licenses in use as follows:

             scontrol show lic
` 
	Note: If you exhaust licenses, you may be locked from using Mathematica
	for a time. Wait a while, and the error will go away.
