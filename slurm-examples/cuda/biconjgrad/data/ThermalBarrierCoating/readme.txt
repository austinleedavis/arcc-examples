These are the converted linear algebra representations for solving the
Thermal Barrier Coating problem.  The system is expressed as K x = f,
where K is the stiffness matrix and f is the loading vector.

K.ell           stiffness matrix in ELL format
K.csr.mtx       stiffness matrix in CSR matrix market format

f.vct           loading vector

constraints.txt  problem constraints used to formulate f' and K'
solutions.vct    true solutions to the problem as given by Dr. Raghavan's group


These problems were developed by Dr. Seetha Raghavan's group as a part of 2011 grant
with NASA/JPL and Intelligent Automation Inc.
